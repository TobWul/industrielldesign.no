Webpage for the designstudents at Industrial Design, NTNU Trondheim.

## Project structure

- `Assets` – All the staticfiles in the project are located here. Static files are files not generated by the users. Can be linked to in html-files with `{% static 'path' %} (remember to add {% load static %} to the top of the file).
  - `css` – All css lies in here. It's written in Sass (.scss), which is a css preprocessor which compiles .scss files to one .css-file. A master file `stylesheet.scss` imports all the other .scss-files in the project and compiles it to one file named `stylesheet.css`.
    - `base` – Global css for all pages.
    - `components` – Css for a globally used component i.e. a button or input fields are placed in this folder.
    - `grid` – A grid system that could be used. If you're interested look into the css, it's not complicated.
    - `pages` – Page specific css. These files should be wrapped in one id to avoid unwanted changes in other pages.
  - `img` – Images not uploaded by users
    - `icons` – Icons in the project
    - `illustrations` – Illustrations in the project.
    - `Logo` – Both an inverse and normal logo in svg.
  - `js` – Javascript files for the project.
    - `404/snake.js` – A snake game made with canvas that's used on the 404-page.
    - `ajaxSetup.js` – Add this script if you're going to use ajax somewhere. It deals with csrf-tokens.
    - `dynamicShadow.js` – A script that creates a moving shadow around an element based on the cursor position.
- `authentication` – Logic for user handling. Authentication and database.
- `books` – Logic to handle book sales
- `courses` – Logic to handle courses. Includes code that populates the database with all NTNU courses (updated spring 2019).
- `dashboard` – Future app. Create an admin dashboard to administrate the page.
